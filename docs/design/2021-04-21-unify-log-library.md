## Motivation or Background

Except for slow query logs, all other logs must satisfy the [unified-log-format RFC standard](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/master/text/2018-12-19-unified-log-format.md).

However, in practice, it was found that the format of logs is confusing:

- There are few logging configuration instructions in the document. We need to enrich document especially the type and the format of logs each component would emit.
- The configured logging parameters do not match the runtime logging, e.g. `tidb_stderr` is configured with text format, but the log is in json format.
- The logs of some components do not meet the [unified-log-format RFC standard](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/23d4f9aed68a295b678e8bd909ee8479e3ba0bd1/text/2018-12-19-unified-log-format.md), e.g. `tiflash_cluster_manager`.
- Duplicate logs, e.g. `pd_stderr` will emit both text and json logs with duplicate content (but with a few subtle differences in timestamps).

## Logging code for each component

### [pingcap/log](https://github.com/pingcap/log)

As a common logging library in PingCAP, it does the following things:

- Provides the standard config schema.
- Provides a factory method for creating log handlers.
- Hard code the log format according to [unified-log-format RFC standard](https://github.com/tikv/rfcs/blob/23d4f9aed68a295b678e8bd909ee8479e3ba0bd1/text/2018-12-19-unified-log-format.md).
- Encapsulates the logic of the rolling file.
- Provides global log handler and related methods for package dimension.

### TiDB

Log library dependencies:

![tidb-log-dependency](./imgs/tidb-log-dependency.png)

For historical reasons, TiDB has two third-party logging libraries, `logrus` and `pingcap/log`. `pingcap/log` is a wrapper of `zap`.

Logs of TiDB can be divided into two types, slow query logs and the other logs. 
As mentioned above, these two types of logs are emitted through two different logging libraries, which results in separate configurations for the two types of logs and requires writing additional configuration conversion code.

TiDB-specific logging logic is written inside `util/logutil/log.go`, e.g., logger initialization, logger configuration, and so on.

Note this file, which is one of the main culprits of circular dependencies. The following briefly describes the key logic in `util/logutil/log.go`, two init methods and four log handlers.

#### logrus

The init method of `logrus` may initialize two `logrus` handlers.

First, it is necessary to initialize the standard log handler (package level handler). `initLogger` first initializes the standard logger according to the configuration.

```go
func InitLogger(cfg *LogConfig) error {
   log.SetLevel(stringToLogLevel(cfg.Level))
   log.AddHook(&contextHook{})

   if cfg.Format == "" {
      cfg.Format = DefaultLogFormat
   }
   formatter := stringToLogFormatter(cfg.Format, cfg.DisableTimestamp)
   log.SetFormatter(formatter)

   if len(cfg.File.Filename) != 0 {
      if err := initFileLog(&cfg.File, nil); err != nil {
         return errors.Trace(err)
      }
   }

// The rest is omitted.
```

Then, determine whether the configuration has enabled slow query log, and if so, create a log handler specific to slow query.

```go
if len(cfg.SlowQueryFile) != 0 {
   SlowQueryLogger = log.New()
   tmp := cfg.File
   tmp.Filename = cfg.SlowQueryFile
   if err := initFileLog(&tmp, SlowQueryLogger); err != nil {
      return errors.Trace(err)
   }
   SlowQueryLogger.Formatter = &slowLogFormatter{}
}
```

Regarding where these two handlers are used.

- Some historical legacy code, such as `cmd/importer/parser.go`, which uses the standard logger by `logrus`.
- Slow query log all uses the slow query log handler created by `logrus`, code in `executor/adapter.go`.

#### [pingcap/log](https://github.com/pingcap/log)

`pingcap/log` is a wrapper around zap, and as mentioned below the two terms are equivalently interchangeable.

Similar to `logrus`, the init method of zap `func InitZapLogger(cfg *LogConfig) error` may initialize two zap handlers.

- The global zap handler, the default log handler for the entire repo, through which the vast majority of logs are emitted.
- Slow query zap handler, which is only initialized and not used.
  
`InitZapLogger`'s logic is very similar to `logrus`' above, so I won't repeat it here.

#### gRPC Logger

I almost forgot that there is a fish in the net, which is not in `util/logutil/log.go`. In `main.go` there is a bunch of grpc logger initialization code.

```go
if len(os.Getenv("GRPC_DEBUG")) > 0 {
   grpclog.SetLoggerV2(grpclog.NewLoggerV2WithVerbosity(os.Stderr, os.Stderr, os.Stderr, 999))
} else {
   grpclog.SetLoggerV2(grpclog.NewLoggerV2(ioutil.Discard, ioutil.Discard, os.Stderr))
}
```

The `NewLoggerV2` method creates a go native logger handler and is only used in grpc.

### PD

PD is similar to TiDB in that it also relies on `logrus` and `pingcap/log`, but with an additional layer of `capnslog` as a proxy. 

Log library dependencies:

![pd-log-dependency](./imgs/pd-log-dependency.png)

#### Logrus

The initialization of `logrus` locates at `pkg/logutil/log.go`ï¼š

```go
// cfg is the config initialized when PD started
// initial logrus logger by cfg
log.SetLevel(StringToLogLevel(cfg.Level))
log.AddHook(&contextHook{})
if cfg.Format == "" {
   cfg.Format = defaultLogFormat
}
log.SetFormatter(StringToLogFormatter(cfg.Format, cfg.DisableTimestamp))
// etcd log
capnslog.SetFormatter(&redirectFormatter{})
// grpc log
lg := &wrapLogrus{log.StandardLogger()}
grpclog.SetLoggerV2(lg)
// raft log
raft.SetLogger(lg)
if len(cfg.File.Filename) == 0 {
   return
}
err = InitFileLog(&cfg.File)
```

The standard logger is then passed down to the etcd (via the `capnslog` proxy), grpc and draft components as the log handler for these packages.

There is only one `logrus` handler inside the entire PD codebase.

Only the etcd, grpc, and draft components use the `logrus` handler.

#### [pingcap/log](https://github.com/pingcap/log)

There is only one zap log handler inside the entire PD codebase, and its initialization is inline `cmd/pd-server/main.go`.

```go
// New zap logger
err = cfg.SetupLogger()
if err == nil {
   log.ReplaceGlobals(cfg.GetZapLogger(), cfg.GetZapLogProperties())
} else {
   log.Fatal("initialize logger error", errs.ZapError(err))
}
// Flushing any buffered log entries
defer log.Sync()
```

The logic is simple, create a new handler based on the configuration and replace the global handler at the `pingcap/log` package level.

Most of the logging logic in PD will use the global zap handler.

### [pingcap/br](https://github.com/pingcap/br)

BR is strangely listed here, it is not a necessary component for the tidb cluster to run. It is here just for one reason: tidb depends on BR, which in turn depends on tidb's `util/logutil/log.go`, constituting a circular dependency. 

Not only is it a circular dependency, it also happens to depend on the log component ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ! This creates a considerable obstacle for the refactor.

The following code is from `pkg/lightning/log/log.go`, which calls TiDB's `InitLogger` and then `pingcap/log`'s InitLogger.

```go
// InitLogger initializes Lightning's and also the TiDB library's loggers.
func InitLogger(cfg *Config, tidbLoglevel string) error {
   // import logutil "github.com/tidb/util/logutil/log.go"
   logutil.InitLogger(&logutil.LogConfig{Config: pclog.Config{Level: tidbLoglevel}})

   logCfg := &pclog.Config{
      Level: cfg.Level,
   }
   if len(cfg.File) > 0 {
      logCfg.File = pclog.FileLogConfig{
         Filename:   cfg.File,
         MaxSize:    cfg.FileMaxSize,
         MaxDays:    cfg.FileMaxDays,
         MaxBackups: cfg.FileMaxBackups,
      }
   }
   // pclog is based on pingcap/log
   logger, props, err := pclog.InitLogger(logCfg)

// The rest is omitted.
```

BR also relies on TiDB's slow log, which he initializes in the main function as `SlowQueryLogger`.

BR also calls TiDB's `InitLogger` twice in two places.

BR also created two different zap handlers in two places, one of which is not used.

These problem codes are not listed here.

To refactor TiDB's logging functionality, you must first change BR to remove the dependency on TiDB log, then let TiDB depend on the new version of BR, and finally refactor TiDB's logging.


## What to do?

There must be something wrong with the engineering of these codes above, and they must be changed. But the cost to change them is not small.

Rationale - for long-term consideration, we should maintain code quality. The speed of output can be sacrificed in time if necessary.

Implementation plan:

1. Unify log library for `pingcap/tidb` first. For dependent parts we write dummy code to satisfy.
2. Unify log library for `pingcap/br`, remove the dependency on `pingcap/tidb/util/logutil`, and clear dummy code of `pingcap/tidb`.
3. Unify log library for `tikv/pd`.

After the implementation, we have `pingcap/tidb`, `pingcap/br`, `tikv/pd` all depend directly on `pingcap/log` and do not depend on any other log libraries (including `std/log`) or each other.
